# kntnt-wp-skills — agent guide

## Ground rules (authoritative)

Precedence over any conflicting skill, README, or other doc unless the user overrides
in the moment.

- Authoritative: only this file, the files it references, and the actual code/state.
  Ignore `README*` and other narrative docs unless referenced here or pointed to.

## References

- `docs/spec.md` — read before implementing: the specification, the single source of truth for the build.
- `docs/adr/` — the settled architectural decisions with rationale; never re-open one as an oversight.
- `CONTEXT.md` — the project glossary; use its terms in code, docs, and dialogue.
- `agents.d/coding-standard/general.md` — read before writing or changing any code
- `agents.d/coding-standard/python.md` — read before writing or changing Python

## Release configuration

- Version locations (keep in sync on every release):
  - `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` — the `version` field (canonical).
  - `CHANGELOG.md` — the latest release heading (promoted from `[Unreleased]`).
- Archive build: none. This is a marketplace-distributed Claude Code plugin; there is no user-facing zip to build or attach.
